# Signals

## Signals in few words

## Signals in details

A [[Signal|signal]] is a notification sent by the [[Kernel]] or a [[Process]][^1] to a [[Process]] that an [[Event]] has occurred.

Types of [[Event]] that can lead to a [[Signal|signal]] being generated by the [[Kernel]] can be:

- **Hardware exception** which can be `number/0`, impossible access of memory, bad instruction, ...
- **The command `CTRL+Z`** sends `SIGTSTP` which **suspends** the [[Process]]
- **The command `CTRL+C`** sends `SIGINT` to the [[Process]] at the foreground of our opened [[Shell]] which **interrupt** the [[Process]], it might close it or do nothing.

```ad-warning

`CTRL+D` just sends `EOF` "End-Of-File", it's not a [[Signals]]

```

These [[Signal]] are defined in `<signal.h>`, here's a few examples

| Name      | Action                      | Integer |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| `SIGINT`  | Interrupt [[Process]]       | 2       |
| `SIGKILL` | Kill [[Process]]            | 9       |
| `SIGTERM` | Ask the [[Process]] to quit | 15      |
| `SIGTSTP` | Suspend [[Process]]         | 20      |
| `SIGCONT` | "Unsuspend" [[Process]]     | 18      |
| `SIGUSR1` | [[User]] [[Signal]] 1       | 10      |
| `SIGUSR2` | [[User]] [[Signal]] 2       | 12      |

### Exercises

Start `gedit`, interrupt it with SIGINT

```shell
➜  ~ gedit
^C
➜  ~ kill -s INT 16390
```

Open a text editor and send it SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGKILL

```shell
➜  ~ kill -s TERM 16527
```

```shell
➜  ~ vim test.txt
Vim: Caught deadly signal TERM
Vim: Finished.
```

SIGINT did nothing with vim.

```shell
➜  ~ gedit
^Z
[1]  + 221993 suspended  gedit
➜  ~ kill -s SIGCONT 221993 # to get back from suspend state
➜  ~ kill -s SIGTSTP 221993 # to go back to suspend state
➜  ~ kill -s SIGKILL 221993 # to kill it
➜  ~ 
[1]  + 221993 killed     gedit
➜  ~ 
```
