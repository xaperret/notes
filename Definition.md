# Definition

## Definition in few words

Generally, a definition is what brings **meaning** to **something**. In computer science, it's similar, indeed usually after [[Declaration]] you can give it **meaning**, **functionality** or simply telling the computers where what has been declared **lives** (memory allocation).
In other words, [[Definition]] gives **meaning** (=>instantiate, implements, defines) the **identifier** or [[Declaration]].

## Definition in details

In C, a definition is a [[Declaration]] `int main(void)` followed by a **block** `{â€¦}`. But we can also see this `int a; // declaration and definition`.
