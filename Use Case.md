# Use Case

## Use Case in few words

A [[Use Case]] is a [[Service]] given by the [[System]].

It is composed
- pre-condition
- post-condition
- value of work
- use scenarios
Each Use Case has a "nominal use scenario", which is the scenario in which everything goes well.
Alternative scenario : scenario which is not nominal but acceptable
Exception scenario : bad stuff
Other scenario are called exception scenario or alternative scenario.

Each thing that happen in a Use Case is called an [[Interaction]] and can be detailed in a [[Interaction Diagram]].
