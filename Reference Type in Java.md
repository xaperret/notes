# Reference Type in Java

## Reference Type in Java in few words

## Reference Type in Java in details

A [[Reference Type in Java]] is basically something that reference an [[Object]] or an [[Array in Java]]. It's **not** a pointer, because we are not using this type to store the address on the [[Stack]].
It can refer a [[Class]] type defined by a class [[Declaration]] or [[Interfaces in Java]] type defined by an [[Interfaces in Java]] [[Declaration]] or an [[Array in Java]] type or an [[Enum]] type.

```java
Patate thisIsARefenrenceType = new Patate();
```
