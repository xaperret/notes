# Industrial Capitalism

## Industrial Capitalism in few words

Fulcher says the [[Industrial Capitalism]] is the exploitation of labour for the motive of [[profit]].
It was also according to him that there was the **invention of [[labour]] and [[leisure]]** as **two separated entities**.
What I found tragic from the book “A very short introduction: Capitalism” is that in 1819 there were “100 children under the age of 10, some as young as 7, who worked from 6.00 in the morning until 7.30 at night.” p. 6.
It's interesting to note that there was some kind of engagement from some boss into the lives of their workers, like *Robert Owen*. I think the implication of such a situation is a very exciting moral problematic.
Drunkenness seemed to be a very big problem. But what is more surprising is that there was rules about cleaning the streets and houses, even curfew.
