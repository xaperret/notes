A [[Process]] is composed of one or more [[Thread]].

A [[Thread]] has a [[Life-Cycle]] that is similar to a [[Process]].

Because **context switching** between [[Thread]]s is faster than between [[Process]]es. [[Thread]]s are sometimes called light [[Process]]es, while [[Process]]es are sometimes called heavy [[Process]]es.
