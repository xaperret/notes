```ad-important

ANSI Standards don't really impose specific size constraints but some types must have the length, e.g 
- `long int` and `unsigned long int`
- `short int` and `int` can have the same size
- `int` can be of 2 bytes

```

[^1]: Size can be different depending on the system implementation, indeed int can be as small as 2 bytes !
[^2]: its `signed/unsigned short/long int`
