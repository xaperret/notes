# GraphQL

## GraphQL in few words

GraphQL is just a specification built around HTTP to receive and send data.
Instead of building a [[Rest API]] with different routes providing different services, you use the queries to have different services. This means instead of having multiple end point, you have just a single one.

### Rest API vs GraphQL

With a [[Rest API]] we are going to make multiple calls if we want a specific thing !
But with GraphQL, it's possible to build one simple query and get everything that we want !
