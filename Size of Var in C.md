# Size of Var in C

## Size of Var in C in few words

## Size of Var in C in details

The method `sizeof(obj)` return the **size** in [[Byte|bytes]] of the given object.
It's also possible to look into `limits.h` and `float.h` to get the maximum **value** of some [[Type in C]].
Like mentioned in [[Type in C]], it's possible sometimes the [[Compiler]] will choose for us the size of a [[Type]] if we declare like so `int`, so we can use specific types like `int8_t` by using `limit.h` to get **specific sizes**.
