## Views in few words

## Views in details

The [[Android UI]] is constituted by many [[Views]].
The `view` [[Class]] has many [[Subclass|subclasses]] which can be grouped into two categories

- [[Widgets]]
- `ViewGroup` that helps for the [[Layout]]

The most common things to do once you have a [[Views|view]] is to

- set properties
- set focus
- set up listeners
- set visibility

### Get views or wigets

```kotlin
// to get widgets
findViewById(R.id.myWidget)
// or to get views
findViewById(R.layout.myView)
```
