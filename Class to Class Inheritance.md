# Class to Class Inheritance

## Class to Class Inheritance in few words

## Class to Class Inheritance in details

Not advised to use.
There are two types of dependence between objects

- [[Composition]], weak dependency, A is composed by B, A owns B
- [[Inheritance]], strong dependency, A inherits from B, A is a B

The first reason why [[Composition]] is a better way to implements to [[Class to Class Inheritance]] is because [[Inheritance]] will expose every method of the [[Superclass]].
The second reason is by using [[Inheritance]], it breaks [[Encapsulation]] because we are saying **A is a B** when we might want to say **A owns B**.
