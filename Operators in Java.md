# Operator

## Operator in few words

## Operator in details

The good practice to use operators is to follow [[Command-query separation CQS]] principles. These principles consist in conceiving methods that either:

- Change state (command)
- Return data (query)

```ad-warning
collapse: open

Don't use `++` and `--`, they are **confusing**, because they do **two** operations instead of **one**.

```
