If you think "Modern" and "C" don't belong in the same sentence, think again. The C standards committee actively reviews and extends the language, with updated published C standards as recently as 2018. In Modern C, author Jens Gustedt teaches you the skills and features you need to write relevant programs in this tried-and-true language, including Linux and Windows, device drivers, web servers and browsers, smartphones, and much more! Modern C teaches you to take your C programming skills to new heights, whether you're just starting out with C or have more extensive experience. Organized by level, this comprehensive guide lets you jump in where it suits you best while still reaping the maximum benefits. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.
