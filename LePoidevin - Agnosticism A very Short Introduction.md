# Agnosticism : A Very Short Introduction

## Key Ideas

There are some history in this book that comes from the book [[The Origins of Agnosticism]] but it's mainly a book about the philosophy of Agnosticism, to answer the question :

- Is agnosticism justified or not, in its answer or attitude towards the existence of god ?
  This book will present a defense of agnosticism, but will not save the reader from using his brain to criticize, be opposed to some ideas presented.
  The author also chooses to present an agnosticism that is compatible with a religious way of life.
