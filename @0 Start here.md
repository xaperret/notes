# About Me

I'm a 29-year-old Computer Science student that right now is mainly interested in learning and improving myself in [[Java]], [[C]], [[Mobile Apps Development]] and [[Algorithms and Datastructures]].
I've recently started developing an interest in [[React]] and [[Typescript]].
Aside from this, I'm mainly reading non-fiction books.
