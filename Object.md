# Object

## Object in few words

## Object in details

An [[Object]] is an [[Instantiation|instance]] of a [[Class]][^1].

An [[Object]] has [[Member|members]] which are

- [[Field]] who represents the **structure** and **state** (_value_) of the [[Object]]
- [[Method]] represents the **behavior** of the [[Object]].

In memory, an [[Object]] contains the [[Reference]] to the _run-time [[Class]]_ it instantiates and the non-static [[Member]] of the [[Object]].

Also see [[Inner Object]].
