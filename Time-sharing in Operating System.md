# Time-sharing in Operating System

## Time-sharing in Operating System in Few Words

A bit like [[Time-sharing Computing]],[^1] Time-sharing in an Operating System is done to give the *illusion* that multiple [[CPU]]s exist.

Each [[Process]] is given a bit of time to execute their [[instruction]] on the [[CPU]].

Unfortunately, this method has a few disadvantages, as in a cost in performance and the implementation necessitate **low-level mechanism**, e.g: to change the Context, and **high-level mechanism**, e.g.: order the [[Thread]]s.
