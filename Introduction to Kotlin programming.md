## Introduction to Kotlin programming in few words

## Introduction to Kotlin programming in details

The first version has been created in 2011, created by **JetBrains**.
It's compiled in _java compatible_ [[Bytecode]], it is therefore executed by the [[Java Machine]].

There are many advantages :

- compact
- [[Statically Type Language]]
- safer
- strong compatibility (retro-compatible with Java)
- official support by **Google**

It's a multi-paradigm programming language, which means we can use what we want depending on the problem we want to solve
