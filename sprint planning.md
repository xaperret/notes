# sprint planning

## sprint planning in few words

## sprint planning in details

The [[Product owner]] and the [[Development team]] agree on a [[sprint goal]].
When figuring out the weight of a [[sprint planning]] we try to fullfill a [[sustainable pace]], which can be extended or reduced by either considering [[default story]] or ignoring them.

A [[feature]] is broken down in [[Task]], which then form the [[sprint backlog]].
Each [[Task]] is estimated in **time**.

A [[sprint]] can last from **two weeks** to a **month**.
A [[sprint planning]] can be completed in 4~8 hours.
