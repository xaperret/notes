# ApolloJS

## ApolloJS in few words

## ApolloJS in details

### Tutorial

A schema first approach, that means we will implement it based on exactly what our client needs :
1. Define Schema : Identify which data is needed, structure it how you need
2. Backend
3. Frontend
This approach allow for faster development since both teams can work together with the defined schema but on different things.
