# UML

## UML in few words

UML, unified modeling language, is the standard modeling language for software and systems development.[^1] It allows us to express the result of analysis and object-oriented conception.

The **advantage** of using [[UML]] is that there isn't much place for interpretation when looking at a standard schema done using [[UML]] standards.

### Analysis

1. Business Analysis
2. System Analysis

### Modelization

- [[Functional Modeling]]
