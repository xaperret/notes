# Planning POKER

## Planning POKER in few words

## Planning POKER in details

Cards are created with numbers on them. Theses **numbers** are at first **abstract**, then they become mapped to “x” hour.
This relation is linked to a specific team.

1. [[Product owner]] selects a PBI to be estimated
2. [[Development team]] discuss & ask clarifying questions
3. Each **estimator** _privately_ selects a card
4. Every card is shown
5. If divergence is too big, then 6., if it’s not then we have reached a **consensus** and that number is the **PBI estimate**
6. Discussion to expose **assumptions** & **misunderstandings**
