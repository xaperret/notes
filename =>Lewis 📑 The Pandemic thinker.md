# The Pandemic Thinker

Bush read a book about the great influenza, the one written by John Barry.
It scared him and push him to have someone make a plan to react to such threat.
Rajeer Verkayya, the head of Biodefence created a plan to have a plan for the president.
Bush then asked for 7 billion to develop this plan.
Bush created the national reserve corps thanks to Richard Hatchett after 9/11 because many doctors and medical professional wanted to provide help and it was difficult to manage them.

The usual response to an infectious disease was to **slow the spread** before we could **make vaccine**.

A team of expert led by Rajeer Venkayya (Carter Mecher, Richard Hatchett, ...) started working on this.

Carter Mecher was part of the VA (big hospital for veteran 250k patiens per day).
There was a scandal due to error, which could have been a statistical error but due to the fact when an error occured the VA reported to congress.....
Study showed that for 1000 patiens -> 3 patients die due to errors
What he did to fix the scandal
-> measure what matters
-> make treatment feel more personnal

Another interesting story

- nurse bath people
- hot water system partly broke
- nurse installed another special valve and upped the setting
- plumber fix system but did not inform nurse
- a patient that yell all the time
- nurse boils alive the patient by accident
  => ENVIRONMENT FAILED THEM

**If a system depends on human vigilence it will fail**

If you need to visit someplace because there is a problem, you visit multiple times to establish trust.

Redesign the environment to make it fool proof

- Codebar for drugs/patients

"Human Error" James Reason

Be systematic with errors

- near mistake
- mistake => tend to fix on bad event, which is a bad way of treating mistakes because when something doesn't go wrong but almost go wrong it needs to be looked at too.

People don't learned what is imposed upon them but rather what they freely seek.
