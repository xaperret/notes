# Formal Language

## What is a Formal Language ?

> For a language to be formalized (or formal), the form of its sentences (or syntax)and their meaning (or semantics) must be precisely and algorithmically defined.

This means that if you have a language, it can be declared as formal if sense can be made out of it using an algorithm.

We can go even further. It means that [[sentences]] in the language must be **grammatically** correct
