## Literature note

Basically, the way I do things, is I use a program to highlight and annotate pdf or ebooks. And then (or at the moment) I create a literature note with a title that I think represent best the idea.
This idea is of course indexed in a bigger note containing all the ideas. This note's purpose is to connect different idea together.
The principle is to keep the system simple.[^1] For some reason if I have trouble putting an idea into a **literature note** then I just highlight it into a weird color or make it so that I understand when I come back what ideas from the book I found interesting but did not _translate_ for some reason.
