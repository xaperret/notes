# The structure of work

For Luhmann the **structure** of the work is much more important than being smart and having willpower. This allows him to affirm the following :

> I never force myself to do anything I don't feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.

A good structure enables flow which is ![[Flow#Quote]]

The structure should allow to also guide work in a way where [[Insight]] and new ideas are the leaders, the driving forces.

This means this system must be flexible enough to allow new information and new ideas and their relationship. This system is [[Zettelkasten]].
