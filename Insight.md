# Insight

Insight is the capacity to gain an accurate and deep understanding of someone or something[^1] And as Ahrens in his book _How to take Smart Notes_ underlines it's something that is **unexpected**.
Meaning we can't possibly predict or anticipate insight, which is why his proposal is to aim our effort using a proper structure.
