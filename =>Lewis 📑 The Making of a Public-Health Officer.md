# The making of a Public-Health Officer

Charity Dean, Santa Barbara

## Tuberculose

Tuberculose is a really dangerous disease.
It's a disease that can lunge itself anywhere. The worst place by far is the lungs, because if it reach the lungs it can be transmitted to other people.
In fact, 30% of people infected by tuberculose had it in their lungs.

A county deputy health officer is a position that is badly paid and who is unknown by the public and government authorities.
Indeed, Charity Dean, a brilliant doctor who decided to become a deputy health officer because of her interest in infectious disease.
The autority of a deputy health officer is actually pretty big, the only one who has a bigger authority is the governor.
If a dho suspect that something that might endanger the public health, he/she can do whatever she wants.

If you're a truck driver, Charity Dean, says you know that you are going to get into an accident at some point. Therefore, you need to be prepared to get over the fear.
She needed to get the lungs tested of a deceased woman who was infected with Tb. The coroner didn't wanted because of a study which said you could get infected if you tried to open someone.
The reality is that this study was bs and if that coroner didn't do his job, more people might have been infected by tb.

She opened the body with garden shears and once the coroner realised she wasn't backing down he helped.

Public health officer is just a job that is just choosen by old doctors, a quiet job.

## Hepatite C

Hepatite C was the infectious disease in 2016 who killed the most American. Now, this disease could be only transmitted by blood.

Even the CDC doubted her authority (Center for disease control).

She shutdowned a doctor with terrible practices who basically infected 4 patients with hep C. He lost his license.

What is interesting to note is that a public officer need to be ready to be fired to work because **a bad decision** means he/she's a goner.

The system was badly funded.

Must show ROI to get politicians to give money, which is a difficult.

## Meningitis B

can kill in hours. The CDC had no advice to give her, in fact they were recommending her to do nothing.
Instead she took risk and decided to preactively cancel all party and give them prophylaxin and also vaccinate them.
90% of the battle against an infectious disease is done in the first days.
CDC recommended to do nothing because they could get blamed. The fear of risk blocked them from doing something.
They ended up publishing a report about what she did and called her each time Menin B broke out somewhere.

A public health officer was less likely to be blamed if he did nothing than if he did something.
