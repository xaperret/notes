# Type in Kotlin

## Type in Kotlin in few words

## Type in Kotlin in details

In [[Kotlin]], everything is an [[Object]].
Some [[Type|types]] can be represented as [[Primitive Type in Java]] values at [[Runtime]] but to the **user** they look like [[Object|objects]].

### Basic Types

- [[Numbers in Kotlin]]
- [[Booleans in Kotlin]]
- [[Characters in Kotlin]]
- [[Strings in Kotlin]]
- [[Arrays in Kotlin]]

### Type Inference and `null`

[[Kotlin]] offers compile-time type safety, because it is a [[statically typed language]].
It goes beyond in terms of safety, as it can distinguishes `nullable` types from `non-nullable` types.

- [[Type Inference]]
- [[Type nullable]]
