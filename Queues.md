# Queues

## Queues in few words

## Queues in details

A **queue** is a [[Linear List]], the difference with a stack is residing in the fact that all insertions are made at **one end of the list** but all **deletions (and usually all accesses) are made at the other end**.

A **queue** is a [[FIFO]] structure.
