# Components of a Class

## Components of a Class in few words

## Components of a Class in details

A [[Class]] might have all or some of the following declarations

```java
{
	field-declarations
	constructor-declarations
	method-declarations
	class-declarations
	interface-declarations
	enum-type-declarations
	initializer-blocks
}
```

So to summarize:

- [[Field]]
- [[Constructor]]
- [[Method]]
- _Nested_ [[Class]]
- _Nested_ [[Interfaces in Java]]
- _Nested_ [[Enum]]
- [[Initializer]]

A [[Field]], [[Method]], nested [[Class]], nested [[Enum]] is called a [[Member]] of the [[Class]], if theses [[Member]] are not using the `Static` [[Keyword]] then we say they are [[Instance Member]].
