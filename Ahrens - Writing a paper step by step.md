# Writing a paper step by step

1. Make **fleeting notes**, they are notes that you write whenever a great idea comes in your head, the kind of notes you put on a piece of paper, a notebook, a napkin, the notes app on your phone, a random txt file named *.txt on your computer, etc...
   At some time in the day you take all these notes and convert them into **permanent notes**.
2. Make **literature notes**, like this document, if you read something, watch something, translate into your own words the meaning of the content you consume and put them into notes with references. Do not copy, try to minimize the amount of quotes
3. Make **permanent notes**, from fleeting notes and literatures notes, create links, insight and thoughts that relates to your research, to your interests, to what you are studying and learning
4. In the notes you created, make more links with related notes by referencing past notes.

In this step you also will order it in your slip-box, you can put it _behind_ another note.
Finally you add it to your index.
5. The step 4 will help you develop questions, understand what topics you need to research, what is missing, ...
You follow your interest, develop, strengthen your arguments, ...
6. Decide on a topic to write about
7. Draft from the notes
8. Edit and proofread your draft => manuscript

The **purpose** of this work structure is to work on **many ideas** at the same time, who are then in **different stages**.
