# CORS

## CORS in few words

CORS is a mechanism that allows a website to request data from another URL.
Browsers implement a "same-origin policy" which means that they will refuse to load any content that is from another website.
We need to fix that on the server, for example using a middleware on [[NodeJS]] to respond with the proper header.
This means that the [[API]] needs to tell browsers and other entities that it can be called from other origins.

### Preflight

Server must say if the demand is allowed (e.g: PUT, PATCH, â€¦). Indeed, the browser will ask the server if it can send it before doing it.
