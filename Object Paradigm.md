# Object Paradigm

## Object Paradigm in Few Words

## Object Paradigm in Details

An [[Object]] is a way to express an [[Abstract Concept]] or a [[Concrete Concept]] by attributing it **variables** and **methods** that represent what this concept **is** and how it **behaves**.

There are three big advantage when it comes to this paradigm.

### Change of State

The first **advantage** of the [[Object Paradigm]] is that we can easily keep the [[State]] of an [[Object]] in memory while exposing neither its structure nor its [[Implementation]].

An [[Object]] possesses many tools to allow its manipulation, but these are hidden. Therefore, we can act on its **state,** not its **structure**.

These **tools** are called [[Method]]. They facilitate the change from one **correct [[State]]** to **another**.

### Code Extensibility

The second advantage is to allow **code extensibility** and good [[Abstraction]] [[Extensibility]] means that we don't have to modify the code to get more out of it.

[[Abstraction]] means that the [[Object]] has been correctly _transformed_ to fully **represent** the possibility that can be attached to a [[Class]].

### Expressive Code

Finally, the third advantage is that our code becomes more **meaningful**.

```java
myDocument.sendTo(myPrinter).withQuantity(10).withFormat("A4").print();
```
