# Total Order

## Total Order in few words

## Total Order in details

> In mathematics, a total or linear order is a partial order in which any two elements are comparable. That is, a total order is a binary relation $\leq$  on some set $X$, which satisfies the following for all $a,b$ and $c$ in $X$

Basically all items are ordered. Therefore, they can be compared and the expectation is that either $a_i \leq a_{i+1}$ or $a_i \geq a_{i+1}$ is true.
