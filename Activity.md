# Activities

## Activities in few words

[[User interface]] for Android. They are stacked on top one another on a [[LIFO]] [[Stack]][^1].

## Activities in details

If an [[App Component]] is an **entry point**, then an [[Activity]] is the **entry point** for **user interaction**.
Indeed, an [[Activity]] is responsible for the **presentation layer** of a given [[Application]].
Each [[Activity]] is linked to one [[User Interface]], which is a file in XML format that describes the **look** of the given [[Activity]].
For each _screen_ we want to display, we need one [[Activity]].

An [[Activity]] uses [[Views]] to draw [[User Interface]] and manage interactivity.
An [[Activity]] is constituted by the [[Application]] [[Context]] and one [[User Interface]]

If an [[Activity]] must have some properties that are common to **existing [[Class|classes]]** you should use them, e.g.

- List of item : `ListActivity`
- Extensible List of item : `ExpandableListActivity`
- Google map : `MapActivity`
- Tabs : `TabActivity`
- Web page : `WebViewClient`
- Preference panel : `PreferenceActivity`
