# Activity Stack

## Activity Stack in few words

## Activity Stack in details

An [[Activity|activity]] is **put** on the [[Stack]] when it **starts**.
An [[Activity|activity]] is **removed** from the [[Stack]] when the button `BACK` is pressed or when we `pop` it.
We can have multiple [[Stack]] in an [[Application]] and within [[Android]].

```ad-info

The button `HOME` doesn't remove the current [[Activity|activity]] from the [[Stack]].
