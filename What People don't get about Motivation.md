# What People don't get about Motivation

## What is motivation ?

### Assumptions from a wrong perspective

**What is motivation, What does it mean ?** Well usually the way people talk about someone who seems _motivated_ is that this person gets up everymorning, goes to the gym, has the displicine to do it, has a goal and goes toward it.

What this is is an **observation** of a **behavior**. This **is not** motivation.
When we want to understand something, we usually look from the outside.

### Duplication

This way is **terrible**, because we will try to replicate the **behavior** without **understanding** _What is motivation_.
We fool ourselves into thinking that motivation is _just_ the **behavior** (the [[Just do it]] mentality).

### Motivation is an internal thing

Motivation exists within the mind, it's not related to our **behavior**.

**What do you think there is in the mind of someone who is motivated ?**

- _"They want it more"_ => Well someone who is 3 weeks sober will likely want it more than someone who is consuming it regularly.
- _"They are disciplined"_ => What is it ? _"They just do it"_

The **reality** is that we can see the **outcome**, the effect, the externality of it, but we **don't** see the **internal** processes of motivation.

We need to understand the **internal** to have the effect. We can't mimic the **effect** and expect to then have the same internal dance as someone who is motivated. Furthermore, mimicking the effect won't last forever or you won't reach what you expected.

### Definition of Motivation

> Motivation is the ability to hold a thought steadily in your mind over a prolonged period of time

## What _kills_ motivation

### Another thought

What makes someone motivated becomes not motivated is the fact that another thought will appear
_"Oh I need to go to the gym"_ <=> _"I want to stay in bed"_

### Procrastination

> Procrastination is your mind's ability to motivate you

_"I want to play videogames"_ <=> Procrastination says _"We got a test"_

Procrastination tries to put a thought steady in your mind.

## Why meditation helps people be more motivated

Because it helps us keep a thought in our head, it has been proven in multiple studies. It also helps people with adhd.

[[Fixed point gazing meditation]] is the most effective.

## _Focusing on the thing I need to do gives me anxiety_

**False**, what is giving anxiety is the **outcome**
Go to the gym **focus not here**

- => People think I'm out of shape => **focus here**
- => I need to get out of bed => **focus here**

## Goals have nothing to do with motivation

People who are motivated tend to be focused on the **action** not the **goal**.
For example, a good student that wants good grade will devotes himself to studying carefully and doing all the exercises twice to accomplish the goal.

People who call themselves **unmotivated** do it because they can't hold a central thought in their mind.

## Self-discipline, long term goal

This is a fallacy that comes from the observation of successful people. They might have a long term goal and the self discipline or they might have a different work structure that make them focus on the action and the goal is just a **fortunate consequence**.

> Discipline is an [[emergent property]]

> Self-discipline is not a real thing

## Conclusion

The fact that meditation is just holding a thought in our head is the reason why even motivated people don't look forward to do some work sometimes.
