# Concurrent Programming

## Concurrent Programming in Few Words

[[Concurrent Programming]] is a [[Programming Paradigm]] which **account**, in a program, of **multiple execution context** ([[Task in Operating System|Task]], [[Thread]], Specialized [[Process]] materialized by a [[Stack]] and private data).

It's useful for many applications, like:

- Interaction with [[Input Output Devices|IO]]
- To launch multiple [[Task in Operating System|Task]] that have been specifically launched independently
- To use more **hardware resources**

### Difference Between Sequential Programming and Concurrent Programming

### Advantages with Concurrent Programming

- Simplify the **program structure**
- Easier **real time** programming depending on the [[Operating System]].
- **Responsiveness**, For example, if you want to use any **hardware** and still be able to do things while using them, or you need to wait for any action (mouse, keyboard, timer, GPIO, â€¦).
- **Resource sharing**, since [[Thread]] shares the same memory and resources of the [[Process]] to which they are attached, then we can have multiple [[Thread]] in the same **address space**.
- **Economy**, allocating memory and resources for [[Process]] creation is costly, but since [[Thread]] shares the resources of the [[Process]] to which they belong, we can use [[Thread]] and **context-switch** them whenever needed.
	- Context switching between [[Thread]] is faster than between [[Process]]
- **Scalability**, by able to use **multicore architectures**, where [[Thread]] might be run in [[Parallel]] on different [[CPU]] cores, which in turns make things like big calculation faster.

### Problem with Concurrent Programming

- Access to shared resources
- Data exchange
- Order of execution
- Synchronization of [[Task in Operating System|Tasks]]
- Predict result
- Reproduce reliably
- Harder to debug. Indeed, the debugger slows down execution, meaning the result might be different.
