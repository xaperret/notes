# Fat tree

The **fat tree network** is a universal [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory "Network theory") for provably efficient communication.

In a [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure) "Tree (data structure)") [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure "Data structure"), every branch has the same thickness, regardless of their place in the hierarchy—they are all "skinny" (_skinny_ in this context means low-[bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing) "Bandwidth (computing)")). In a fat tree, branches nearer the top of the hierarchy are "fatter" (thicker) than branches further down the hierarchy.
