## model in few words

A model is always a model of something. A model is an abstraction of this *something* by making **statements of interests**.

A model will either be a representation of what **is** or what **should be** depending on it is made on an **existing [[System]]** or **soon-to-be existing [[System]]**.

This *something* can be a [[System]] that is constrained within a [[Domain]].
