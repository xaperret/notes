# Set

## Set in few words

## Set in details

A set is::a collection of distinct elements.

<!--SR:2021-07-28,20,230-->

Another way to look at a set is to image it as a _box_ containing objects that we will call _elements_. There is no hierarchy or order between the elements of a set.

### Mathematical definition

Be _E_ a [[Set]] and _x_ an **object** then $x \in E$ means

- _x_ belongs to _E_
- _x_ is an element of _E_
- _E_ contains _x_
- _x_ is inside _E_
