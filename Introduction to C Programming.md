# Introduction to C Programming

## Introduction to C Programming in few words

## Introduction to C Programming in details

### Birth

[[C]] was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs between 1969 and 1973.
The reason why it was developed was to be able to program with a language who didn't have to be rewritten on every machine.
The code could be instead recompiled by a [[Compiler]].
Why this was needed ? Well [[UNIX]] needed it as its kernel would be written in [[C]].

### Standards

To avoid the errors of their time (not have 50 billion different C version) standards were created for [[C]] to warrant **portability**.
This meant defining

- [[Type]]
- [[Header]]
- [[Constant from Standards Libraries]]
