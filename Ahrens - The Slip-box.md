# The slip-box

Basically a slip-box is just a system where thinking, organization of thought, ideas and fact happens.
Ahrens says to focus on the essentials when using the slip-box. The slip-box is not another technique, it's at the root of our work.
We should therefore keep it simple so that we don't get distracted from what is important : reading, thinking, writing, etc...
Indeed if our system becomes too complex, then we spend too much time on what should be allowing us to work in the first place.
