## What is a Distributed System

It's something that has the following characteristics
- Communication
- Coordination
- Memory **must be** distributed and can be shared
- Independent CPU
- Protected from crashes

Computing is by default distributed today :
- [[High Performance Computing]]
- [[Mobile networks]]
- [[IoT]]
