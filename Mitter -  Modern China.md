# Modern China

## Key Ideas

A travel description taken out of a century old book about China is still true today as Mitter write. Indeed, China took a long time to modernize itself because it took many turns before it found its way.

China functioned under an imperialist system until 1911 when a revolution pushed China into a republic. It then failed after almost 4 decades and the People's Republic of China surfaced.

Today, China is the most populous country in the world.
It had 10% economic growth from the start of the 21st century until ~2010.
And after it's _coming out_ into the world of nation (symbolised by the 2008 olympic games in Being), it started having a lot more financial and political interests into Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia (North Korea, ...).

China went and is going through massive change, represented by the idea _peaceful rise_ or _peaceful development_ (1990s, Zheng Bijian).
Massive urbanization, loads of cash (account surplus, currency devaluation which caused some concerns with US/EU).

Mitter talks about a [[gray zone of cultural production in China]].

Although it's successful economically, it's one of the most unequal country the lower classes are struggling financially in regards to healthcare and high education.
It's facing also environmental and ressource challenges as there are power outtages, huge fogs accross its cities (biggest CO2 producer).

There is also a decent amount of corruption. But China of today is much stronger than it was in the beginning of the 20th century as it was facing western and Japanese imperialism.

This book attempts to show China in light of its history : a party scared by collapse (as it had plenty in its past) and three important points

- We should not see China as a country closed to outside influence, because its growth wasn't [[=>Mitter ğŸ“‘ China is not closed to outside influence]]
- [[=>Mitter ğŸ“‘ Second]]
- [[=>Mitter ğŸ“‘ Third]]
