# Anxiety 101
Anxiety has multiple facets :
- Emotion anxiety -> "I feel anxious"
- Cognitive anxiety -> "I have anxious thoughts",
- Diagnosed anxiety -> Illness

## Why do we have it ?
Our brain evolved in different ways. Anxiety is a protective mecanism to make us safe. Protect us from suffering or danger.
Source of suffering -> fuel anxiety

## What is anxiety ?
Anxiety is the **future** focused mind.
Anxiety is our mind thinking about the future.
=> remedies => present => playing video games, procrastination, video games
=> meditation that makes us go back to the present helps us feel less anxious

## Where does it come from ?
One is cognitive, one is physical.

If we neglect one of those then it gets worse.
Anxiety = see a doctor => emphasize the cognitive

[[Cognitive Anxiety]] is about particular fear or insecurities. These insecurities come from experiences in our earlier life.

[[Physiologic Anxiety]] is where our brain and body create the feeling of anxiety. The adrenaline surge which will make sweaty palms and cramp in our stomach, make our thoughts black/white :
- Adrenaline => makes our thoughts black/white yes/no. "These people are laughing at me"
- Cortisol => activated by anxiety, prevent us from sleeping, relaxing

Anxiety can come from body or mind.

## What is the process of anxiety ?
Thought -> Thought -> Thought => Overwhelming
Thought overload
- avoid the situation => promotion, driving, etc... => giving in our fears => feel traps
- wanting reassurance => alleviate anxiety => makes us dependant
