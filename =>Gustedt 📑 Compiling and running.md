# Compiling and running C

For most programming language (unless you are coding in binary code) the code needs to be converted into something the machine can understand, what is called **binary code** or **executable**. This is done using a [[Compiler]].
The **binary code** is platform dependent, meaning the result will depend on the machine where you compiled it.

C is not different, we need to compile C code into binary code to use what we wrote. Therefore C is a **compiled programming language**.

According to Jen Gustedt a correct C program should be **portable** between different platforms and compile cleanly without warnings, meaning that its **behavior** should be the same accross platforms.

It's important to use the right flag for the given compiler to have a good amount of verbose, so that you can see the errors, warning and problems that need to be solved.
