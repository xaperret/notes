# History of Operating Systems

## History of Operating Systems in few words

## History of Operating Systems in details

### 1960s MULTICS

[[MULTICS]] was a project developed by **General Electric**, **MIT** and **Bell Laboratories**.
**Bell Laboratories** pulled out of the project in 1969.

Ken Thompson, an employee of Bell Laboratories involved, thought MULTICS was too complex and started to work on a simpler version called UNICS.

### 1970 - First Operating System

UNICS quickly became [[UNIX]], which was the **first operating system**. It was exploited by the "New York Telephone Company" seven years without any change.

### 1972 - C & rewriting of UNIX

To have better compatibility [[UNIX]] was **rewritten in [[C]]**, a language which was capable of being used on a variety of platform due to the fact the source code was not different
The burden of compatibility was put **on the compiler**.

### 1982 - Berkley-Software Distribution

The first **[[Distribution]]**, called BSD, is created by the University of Berkley.

### 1983 - Privatization

Until 1983, **[[UNIX]]'s source code** was **given** with the software, because _AT&T_ was **legally obligated to give it**.
Following **privatization** laws, _AT&T_ was **no longer required to do so**. Therefore, a lot of companies started creating **their own clone of [[UNIX]]**, which in the long run was going to cause **incompatibilities** issues.

### 1983 - GNU

GNU is Not Unix, was a movement started by **Richard Stallman** which purpose was to create **a [[free]] clone of [[UNIX]]**.
He started by creating **a text-editor called [[Emacs]]**.

### 1984 - First Graphic System

The _X Window System_ was the first Graphic system. It was based on a [[Client-Server]] System. Applications would work like [[Server]] feeding a [[Client]] data.
This means that **it could work through the network.**

### 1988 - Standard POSIX

The large number of Operating System were going right into the wall of **incompatibility** if not checked by some kind of regulation.
In 1988, the [[POSIX]] standards were introduced by IEEE, which regulated a lot of element in a way that would help **compatibility** and **portability** between [[Operating System]].

### 1991 - GNU/Linux

Linus Torvalds creates **[[GNU Linux]] and propose his [[Kernel]]** to [[GNU]].

### 2001 - Mac OSX

The [[Operating System]] for Apple computers that was developed with the [[Kernel]] and environment from [[FreeBSD]].
Libraries from [[NextSTEP]] with inspiration from [[NextSTEP]]'s GUI.
